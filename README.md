# MSc_work_Multi_crop_yield_Estimation
This repository includes all the developed codes for the MSc work of multi-crop yield estimation. It contains the data preparation, downloading and processing pipelines. Furthermore, it contains all the code of the developed DL models. Those DL models are:
1- Base CNN for multi-crop yield estiamation using 8 bands of sentinel-2 images
2- Base CNN for multi-crop yield estiamation using 8 bands of sentinel-2 images. Additionally the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is added as a 9th band.
3- U-net multi-task model for crop type identification and yield estimation
4 - Swin multi-task model for crop type identification and yield estimation
